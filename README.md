FM Tools
========

**currently in alpha**

vgm2opm
-------
Similar to Shiru's vgm2opm, it extracts 4-op FM voices from vgm files. Unlike Shiru's vgm2opm, it supports more chips, such as the OPN\* series and OPM, and limited support for OPL\*. It uses roughly the same algorithm to compact duplicate voices.

Dumping tools
-------------
`opmdump`, `insdump`, `dmpdump`, `tfidump`, `y12dump` dump voice files in csv format. These are meant for importing the data into a database.
